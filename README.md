# Grape_Segmentation
I have utilized the wgisd-grape dataset and trained the Mask-RCNN model for segmentation of grapes in vineyards with detectron2 which is pytorch-based platform. In addition, I am developing a project to track and count the grapes. (https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)

Here is the dataset link:https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wgisd

The code includes training the mask RCNN, detecting the grapes, and finding the center point of the grapes to help count the number of grapes in a photo.The project will continue.
