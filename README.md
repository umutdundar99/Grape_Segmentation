# Grape_Segmentation
I have utilized wgisd-grape dataset and trained Mask-RCNN model for segmentation of grapes in vineyard. In addition, I am developing the project to track and count the grapes

https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wgisd for dataset

The code includes training the mask RCNN, detecting the grapes, and finding the center point of the grapes to help count the number of grapes in a photo.The project will continue.
